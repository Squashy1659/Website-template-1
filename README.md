# Website-template-1
This is a little website I once made for uni. You can use it as a template for your own projects :)

> **Note** <br>
>This website was purely designed and made **ONLY** for a 1920x1080px screen as these were one of the requirements back then. <br>
>It will not work on any other screen size and lots of rewriting is going to be necessary. 
>If you still wish to take a look at it, just zoom out or in to adjust to your screen size and pixel density.
>Take this webite more as type of inspiration then an actual template.
